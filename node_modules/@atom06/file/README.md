# File Class v2.1.0

This is a simple Node.js class for reading and writing files. It is written in typescript by me (atom06) for the nexus project

[github](https://gist.github.com/atom06/45ff6aeabe74d249965e0776dcb14a2f) ||
[npm](npm.im/@atom06/file) _(you can use the same to download in yarn/pnpm)_

## Usage

```js
import IO from '@atom06/file';

const file = new IO('test.txt');

// Write data to the file
const [writeSuccess, writeError] = await file.write('Hello, world!');

if (writeSuccess) {
  console.log('Data written to file successfully.');
} else {
  console.error('Error writing to file:', writeError);
}

// Append data to the file
const [appendSuccess, appendError] = await file.append('New data to append.');

if (appendSuccess) {
  console.log('Data appended to file successfully.');
} else {
  console.error('Error appending to file:', appendError);
}

// Read data from the file
const [readSuccess, data] = await file.read();

if (readSuccess) {
  console.log('File data:', data);
} else {
  console.error('Error reading file:', data);
}

```
## API

### new File(fileName): File
Create a new File instance with the given file name opening that file.

### file.write(data: string): Promise<[boolean, string | unknown]>
Write data to the file. Returns a promise that resolves to a tuple containing a boolean indicating success (true) or failure (false) and either undefined (if successful) or an error object (if failed).

### file.read(): Promise<[boolean, string | unknown]>
Read the contents of the file. Returns a promise that resolves to a tuple containing a boolean indicating success (true) or failure (false) and either the contents of the file (if successful) or an error object (if failed).

### file.append(data: string): Promise<[boolean, string | unknown]>
Append data to the end of the file. Returns a promise that resolves to a tuple containing a boolean indicating success (true) or failure (false) and either undefined (if successful) or an error object (if failed).
